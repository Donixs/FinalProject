Building your computer can be a fulfilling task where with the right parts, you can create a fully functioning personal computer. Building a personal computer is an interesting hobby that is constantly evolving with advances in technology. While people think this continuous progress may invalidate their computers, some workplaces use parts from 2011 and are still capable computers for simple workloads like Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, and emailing. Depending on your workloads and preferences, your computer can last you upward of five or six years, barring any issues. 

Building your own computer offers benefits such as saving money as opposed to buying a prebuilt computer, personalizing your computer to your workload, and even tailoring the aesthetics of the PC. Moreover, but depending on the type of component and manufacturer, you are more likely to get better warranties than prebuilt computers. 

1.1 History of building Personal Computers
==========================================
Building computers has been an enthusiasts' field for a long time, and before the late 80s it was limited to specialists who had a background in computer science and electrical engineering. During the late 80s though, IBM began standardizing a great deal of components, allowing for a wider audience. People could buy these standardized parts from shops and with some research were able to assemble the computer and use them for personal use. As the years went on, computers became more common in day to day life, and hobbyist and enthusiasts could enter the market as the industry continue to grow to massive proportions. Many corporations sold products not only as OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer; parts sold to other companies such as Dell, HP, etc.), but also to consumers. Corporations like Intel, AMD, Nvidia, ASUS, EVGA sell their products to not just other companies, but as standalone products to consumers. Nvidia released a quarterly trend at the close of their Q4FY16, showing a steady increase in their "gaming" (consumer variant) revenue, as shown below.
