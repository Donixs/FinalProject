2. Components necessary for building to your own computer
*********************************************************

This section outlines the "core" requirements for building your own computer. This list is not definitive, and can vary depending on your decisions on building your own computer. A motherboard will not fit all CPUs or fit in all cases; be sure to ensure all parts are compatible before purchasing each part. The rest of the guide assumes you have already purchased the parts. If you have not, there are websites which you can purchase the parts from like Newegg.com, Amazon.com, Monoprice.com, Ebay.com; and local sellers like Microcenter and Fry's. Failure to ensure compatibility can result in damage to components.
