4.1 Installing Windows
======================

This guide will focus on the installation of Windows through a USB. If you wish to use a disk installation, you will either need to prepare the installation of a CD reader into your computer or buy a USB CD reader. Microsoft created a guide on how to create an installation device on your USB in the link below.

4.2.1 Motherboard drivers
-------------------------

Along with the USB for Windows installation, you should have at least a 2GB USB ready for use as well. With this you will go onto your motherboard's manufacturer's website and find your specific model on the site. From there you'll download all the latest drivers (usually as .exe or .zip files) and place them on the USB. Bring them to the newly built computer, insert the USB and install each driver. Usually each driver will ask for you to restart at completion, please do so.

4.3 Wrapping up
===============
After installing the drivers, your computer is all set. You can install software like Google Chrome, Microsoft Office, or anything you wish. It is suggested you get anti-virus software like Avast or Norton's Security before doing too much, as your computer only has the built in Windows anti-virus security.
There are issues that can pop up during building the computer or after, it is best to always ready to google anything. The DIY Computer community on `Reddit <http://reddit.com/r/buildapc>`_ is great for people to look over your computer components before purchasing to ensure everything is correct or necessary, and if you have issues during or after building your computer they can be very helpful in answering questions.
