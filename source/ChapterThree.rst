3. Putting these components together
************************************
3.1 Installing the motherboard
==============================
3.1.1 Introduction
------------------
Motherboards are the connecting piece of all computers. Everything at some point connects through the motherboard. Whether it is the computer fans or the CPU, all components go through it. They come in a variety of form factors but the most common ae ATX and mATX.

3.1.2 Installation
------------------
1. Take your computer case and remove the side panels.
2. Take the golden standoffs and hand screw into the case depending on your formfactor, see the accompanying figure (2).

3. Once the standoffs are screwed in, slide the IO shield into the back of the case until you hear a click. Caution, the IO shields are usually made of aluminum and have sharp edges, which can cause minor cuts.
4. Once the IO shield and gold standoffs are in place, align the IO panel of the motherboard and the IO shield together, then gently slide the motherboard into place. The IO panel should slip into the IO shield and the motherboard should align with the standoffs.
5. Use the provided motherboard screws and screw the motherboard into the standoffs. A preferred method is the Cross-method, screwing in halfway top left, then bottom right, then top right, then bottom left, then center screws. Once all screws are in, fully tighten them. 

3.2 Installing the Power Supply Unit
====================================
3.2.1 Introduction
------------------
The PSU attaches to the back of the inside of the case, and depending on how modern your case is, it could be attached to the top or the bottom. This step will require both hands, one hand to screw the PSU in and another to hold it up if you are attaching to the top of the case. The PSU should have a fan at the bottom of it, which almost always faces downward. If the bottom of your case does not have an opening for the PSU fan, it may be required to face it upward, refer to your computer case manual in such situations. 

3.2.2 Installation
------------------
1. Insert the power supply unit(PSU). Once the PSU is oriented and against the slot, begin screwing in the PSU into the case. Once again, use the cross-method. 
2. Once the PSU is installed, there should be a provided outlet plug from the PSU. Plug the socket end into the PSU, and the outlet end into a grounded source.
3. Leave the PSU power switch on O. See the accompanying figure (3).
