3. Putting these components together
************************************
3.1 Installing the motherboard
==============================
3.1.1 Introduction
------------------
Motherboards are the connecting piece of all computers. Everything at some point connects through the motherboard. Whether it is the computer fans or the CPU, all components go through it. They come in a variety of form factors but the most common ae ATX and mATX.

3.1.2 Installation
------------------
1. Take your computer case and remove the side panels.
2. Take the golden standoffs and hand screw into the case depending on your formfactor, see the accompanying figure (2).

*Figure 2*

3. Once the standoffs are screwed in, slide the IO shield into the back of the case until you hear a click. Caution, the IO shields are usually made of aluminum and have sharp edges, which can cause minor cuts.
4. Once the IO shield and gold standoffs are in place, align the IO panel of the motherboard and the IO shield together, then gently slide the motherboard into place. The IO panel should slip into the IO shield and the motherboard should align with the standoffs.
5. Use the provided motherboard screws and screw the motherboard into the standoffs. A preferred method is the Cross-method, screwing in halfway top left, then bottom right, then top right, then bottom left, then center screws. Once all screws are in, fully tighten them. 

3.2 Installing the Power Supply Unit
====================================
3.2.1 Introduction
------------------
The PSU attaches to the back of the inside of the case, and depending on how modern your case is, it could be attached to the top or the bottom. This step will require both hands, one hand to screw the PSU in and another to hold it up if you are attaching to the top of the case. The PSU should have a fan at the bottom of it, which almost always faces downward. If the bottom of your case does not have an opening for the PSU fan, it may be required to face it upward, refer to your computer case manual in such situations. 

3.2.2 Installation
------------------
1. Insert the power supply unit(PSU). Once the PSU is oriented and against the slot, begin screwing in the PSU into the case. Once again, use the cross-method. 
2. Once the PSU is installed, there should be a provided outlet plug from the PSU. Plug the socket end into the PSU, and the outlet end into a grounded source.
3. Leave the PSU power switch on O. See the accompanying figure (3).

3.3 Installing the CPU
======================
3.3.1 Introduction
------------------

The next step requires caution and double checking before proceeding. Failure to ensure this can cause destruction of components. All modern CPUs and motherboards follow the standardized orientation of the CPU. The socket at the center of the motherboard will have a lever and metal latch. 

3.3.2 Installation
------------------

1.	Pull the lever outward lightly and lift it up, then lift the latch up. This will expose the socket, look it over carefully. You should note two little plastic bulges on each side of the socket, and a small outlined triangle in one of the corners. 

2.	Take your CPU and take note of the indents on the sides of it, and the golden triangle on the corner of the CPU. Follow the orientation of the socket and place the CPU into the socket. The two indents should be filled by the plastic bulges, and the golden triangle should cover the outline of the triangle. Figure 4 is an example of a correctly oriented CPU.

*Figure 4(Saunders 2014)*

3.	Pull down the latch and then begin slowly but firmly pulling down the lever. You should feel pressure building up on the CPU, this is fine as the latch is ensuring the CPU is making contact the motherboard. Once the latch is completely pulled down, slip the hook into the socket so it does not lift again.

4.	Depending on your PSU, your PSU should have cables attached to it that face into the case or be provided with cables that can be plugged into the PSU. There are two cables we need to worry about right now, the large 24-pin connector, and the 8-pin connector. Each should be labeled accordingly. The 24-pin connector should fit into the motherboard on the right side of it, orient the pin correctly as there is a latch on the connector, slip the connector into the slot and the latch should hook on. 

5.	The next connector will be the CPU connector, the slot should be near the top left of the motherboard, near the CPU. Slip the CPU connector into the slot, and the latch should hook on. 

3.4 Installing the RAM
======================
3.4.1 Introduction
------------------
The next step is placing in the RAM. Depending on your purchase, you may have one or two sticks of RAM (or more, but general consumers usually purchase one or two due to cost efficiency). This will be one of the few steps where you will need to apply some force, but a delicate amount of force. Look at your RAM stick(s) and examine the gold pins at the bottom. There should be a little gap between them. Now look at the motherboard and see the RAM slots, and there should be a protruding spot, inverse of the RAM stick. Figure 5 should explain the orientation.

*Figure 5*

3.4.2 Installation
-------------------
1.	There should also be two latches on the sides of the slot, pull them gently back so that they are at an angle. Line up the RAM stick on the RAM slot so the protruding spot lines up with the gap. 

2.	Gently apply force on both sides of the RAM stick. 
3.	As you push down on both sides of the RAM, you should notice the latches move and you will hear an audible click. If both latches are back to their proper upright orientation, you will know the RAM is seated properly.

4.	If only one is latched, you will need to start over and make sure you are applying enough pressure on both ends of the stick.

5.	Repeat this entire step for however many RAM sticks you have.


3.5 Installing CPU cooler
=========================
3.5.1 Introduction
------------------
Now the next step is varied based on the motherboard and CPU, so this step may be different for yours. Be sure to read the manual given to you based on whether you are using a stock cooler or an aftermarket cooler. For this section we will refer do the two most recent sockets, Intel's LGA1151 and AMD's AM4 socket. Both stock coolers have similar installation, there may only be one extra step for AMD users. Take note that while the stock coolers are similar in design, you cannot switch between them. An AMD stock cooler will not work on an Intel motherboard, or vice versa. AMD motherboards sometimes have a mounting bracket already installed, unscrew these brackets from your motherboard.

3.5.2 Installation
------------------

1.	Now, both stock coolers have four screws in each corner. Line up the screws into the open holes surrounding the CPU.

2.	Gently place the cooler on top of the CPU.

3.	Begin screwing in the CPU cooler in the cross-method until all are screwed in halfway, then tight them so that the cooler is firmly in place, but be wary of over-tightening. 

4.	Take the cable coming from the stock cooler and look for pins on the motherboard that are labeled "CPU_FAN". Take your cable and slide them into the pins. This will provide power to the stock cooler and ensure it works.


3.6 Setting up system case panel
================================

3.6.1 Introduction
-------------------
All motherboards come with a system panel that allow you to connect the cables from your case that provide functions such as the power button and LEDs. Each cable almost always includes a power and ground wire. Refer to your motherboard manual and computer case manual to figure out the proper orientation for your cables. Below is a picture of system panel partially filled.

3.6.2 Installtion
------------------
Gently slide the cables onto the pins once orientation has been determined.


3.7 Installing Graphics Card
=============================
3.7.1 Introduction
-------------------
Graphic cards are components that render and display content on monitors or TVs. They are designed to fit into PCIE slots but can vary in size and length. Some graphic cards require power cables from the PSU so have the PSU to PCIE cables ready.

3.7.2 Installation
-------------------

1.	Begin by taking off any plastic layering that may be on the graphics card. There should also be a plastic cap over the golden pins, as depicted in figure 7.
 
|GPUpicture|
 
*Figure 7*


2.	Your computer case should have thin plastic covering acting as exhaust ports, much like the picture below. Depending on the size of your graphics card, remove the screws keeping the PCIE covers in place that are closest to the top PCIE slot (the black line with the latch as pictured below). Generally, two covers are enough to remove. 

|PCIEpicture|

*Figure 8*

3.	Once the covers are removed, slide the graphics card's gold pin connector into the PCIE slot, ensuring it has been oriented. An audible click should be heard once the graphics card is fully inserted into the PCIE slot. The metal cover at the end of the graphics card should effectively replace the removed covers.

4.	If your graphics card requires additional power, grab the 6+2 pin cable from the PSU and attach it into the power slots of the graphics card.
