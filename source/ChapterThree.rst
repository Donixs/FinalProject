3. Putting these components together
************************************
3.1 Installing the motherboard
==============================
3.1.1 Introduction
------------------
Motherboards are the connecting piece of all computers. Everything at some point connects through the motherboard. Whether it is the computer fans or the CPU, all components go through it. They come in a variety of form factors but the most common ae ATX and mATX.

3.1.2 Installation
------------------
1. Take your computer case and remove the side panels.
2. Take the golden standoffs and hand screw into the case depending on your formfactor, see the accompanying figure (2).

3. Once the standoffs are screwed in, slide the IO shield into the back of the case until you hear a click. Caution, the IO shields are usually made of aluminum and have sharp edges, which can cause minor cuts.
4. Once the IO shield and gold standoffs are in place, align the IO panel of the motherboard and the IO shield together, then gently slide the motherboard into place. The IO panel should slip into the IO shield and the motherboard should align with the standoffs.
5. Use the provided motherboard screws and screw the motherboard into the standoffs. A preferred method is the Cross-method, screwing in halfway top left, then bottom right, then top right, then bottom left, then center screws. Once all screws are in, fully tighten them. 

3.2 Installing the Power Supply Unit
====================================
3.2.1 Introduction
------------------
The PSU attaches to the back of the inside of the case, and depending on how modern your case is, it could be attached to the top or the bottom. This step will require both hands, one hand to screw the PSU in and another to hold it up if you are attaching to the top of the case. The PSU should have a fan at the bottom of it, which almost always faces downward. If the bottom of your case does not have an opening for the PSU fan, it may be required to face it upward, refer to your computer case manual in such situations. 

3.2.2 Installation
------------------
1. Insert the power supply unit(PSU). Once the PSU is oriented and against the slot, begin screwing in the PSU into the case. Once again, use the cross-method. 
2. Once the PSU is installed, there should be a provided outlet plug from the PSU. Plug the socket end into the PSU, and the outlet end into a grounded source.
3. Leave the PSU power switch on O. See the accompanying figure (3).

3.3 Installing the CPU
======================
3.3.1 Introduction
------------------

The next step requires caution and double checking before proceeding. Failure to ensure this can cause destruction of components. All modern CPUs and motherboards follow the standardized orientation of the CPU. The socket at the center of the motherboard will have a lever and metal latch. 

3.3.2 Installation
------------------

1.	Pull the lever outward lightly and lift it up, then lift the latch up. This will expose the socket, look it over carefully. You should note two little plastic bulges on each side of the socket, and a small outlined triangle in one of the corners. 

2.	Take your CPU and take note of the indents on the sides of it, and the golden triangle on the corner of the CPU. Follow the orientation of the socket and place the CPU into the socket. The two indents should be filled by the plastic bulges, and the golden triangle should cover the outline of the triangle. Figure 4 is an example of a correctly oriented CPU.

3.	Pull down the latch and then begin slowly but firmly pulling down the lever. You should feel pressure building up on the CPU, this is fine as the latch is ensuring the CPU is making contact the motherboard. Once the latch is completely pulled down, slip the hook into the socket so it does not lift again.

4.	Depending on your PSU, your PSU should have cables attached to it that face into the case or be provided with cables that can be plugged into the PSU. There are two cables we need to worry about right now, the large 24-pin connector, and the 8-pin connector. Each should be labeled accordingly. The 24-pin connector should fit into the motherboard on the right side of it, orient the pin correctly as there is a latch on the connector, slip the connector into the slot and the latch should hook on. 

5.	The next connector will be the CPU connector, the slot should be near the top left of the motherboard, near the CPU. Slip the CPU connector into the slot, and the latch should hook on.
